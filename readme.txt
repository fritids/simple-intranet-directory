== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I change the look of my employee directory? =

You can edit the style sheet file called "si_employees.css" found in the /css folder.  This includes classes for the "employeephoto" and "employeebio" areas of the directory.

= How can I change the size of the employee photos? =

Click on "Users / Employee Photos" and down the page under "Photo Options" you will see the third option is for the size of the photos in pixels.

= I'm uploading employee photos but they are not appearing or saving? =

This is typically caused by a folder or a permission issue.  First ensure you are uploading to the right folder, and test the image URL in a separate browser to see if it has uploaded.  Also, under "Users / Employee Photos" and down the page under "Photo Options" your will see an option for "User Uploads" where you can manually set the Avatar upload directory.  Be sure you have "write" privileges and not just "read" privileges.  You may have to use a FTP or HTML editor to "CHMOD" the folder to change permissions to allow "write" access.
